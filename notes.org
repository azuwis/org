dm-writeboost target provides block-level log-structured caching. All cache
data, writes and reads, are written to the cache device in sequential manner.

dm-writeboost controls three different layers - RAM buffer (rambuf), cache
device (cache_dev, e.g SSD) and backing device (backing_dev, e.g. HDD). All data
are first stored in the RAM buffer and when the RAM buffer is full,
dm-writeboost adds metadata block (with checksum) on the RAM buffer to create a
"log". Afterward, the log is written to the cache device as background
processing in sequential manner and thereafter it's written back to the backing
device in background as well.
